# SpaceXProject
This project was part of the Coursera IBM Data Science specialization certificate course. This is a final capstone project that aims to practice all the concepts learned throughout the certificate program and apply it.

The goal of the project is to act as a peer organization to SpaceX in which we analyze launch data from SpaceX to optimize our own rocket tests. 

We scrape data from Wikipedia and use the SpaceX API to gather information. A multitude of visualization tools and machine learning algorithms are used within this project. It then culminates to a power point presentation that is also included in this repository.
